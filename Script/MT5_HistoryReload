"Hey, did you ever figure out how to get the CMSM working? I'm having the same issue. Screen shot and Experts Log attached."

Grandaevus:
There's a bug in mt5. Terminal stops updating history when you attach an indicator/ea that use multi time frames & multi symbols.

In order to force the terminal to make it load the needed history please open 7 new charts for the following symbols.

EURUSD , GBPUSD , USDCHF , USDJPY , USDCAD , AUDUSD , NZDUSD (TimeFrame = CMSM Timeframe Setting which is 4H in your case)

Wait terminal to load the required history.

Close the charts.
