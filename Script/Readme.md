USE THE ForceLoadHistoricalData.ex4 ONLY ON THE MT4 PLATFORM

Use this Script or MT5 instruction if you run into problems with the Cffp-diff or CMSM indicators not showing up on the charts.
This will populate the history files for each symbol (or indicated symbols on MT5) so that the indicators have the the history they require to operate.

PLace the orceLoadHistoricalData.ex4 file in the MQL4\Scripts folder and run on any MT4 chart.  Instructions and progress will appear in the Expert Logs. Depending on how much you require, it may take some time for the Script to accomplish its function.

For MT5, read the instructions that Grandaevus provides in the file MT5_HistoryReload
